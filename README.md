# Localize

### Localize is a project to bring local and big businesses together to grow as a community.

# Background and Overview

New businesses are moving in and growing. Neighborhoods are changing. Managing the growth and change of a neighborhood while keeping the character and soul of what made that area special is difficult. Localize provides the means to have that conversation. We have created a space for larger businesses to connect with smaller, local businesses for their specific needs.
